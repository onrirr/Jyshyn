# Jyshyn - Open-source interactive language learning

Jyshyn, <kbd> /jɯʃɯn/</kbd> or <kbd>yışın</kbd> is a platform created to bring endangered or less attention receiving languages to global audiences in an open source and collaborative format with a Duolingo-like gamified approach.

## Why?

Some languages are widely spoken with little to no resources and some are not spoken well. We bring languages to global audiences to better promote the world's cultural diversity.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Home page
- [ ] The first course
  - [ ] Arrange the words
  - [ ] Complete the translation
  - [ ] Picture - Word matching
  - [ ] Read and Respond
  - [ ] Fill in the blanks
  - [ ] Match the pairs
  - [ ] Listening exercises (on hold for now.)
-  [ ] Achievements
-  [ ] Streaks
-  [ ] Stories with translations

## Approach

Multiple endpoints will probably be used for the courses, all of them being in some form of different space. The courses will probably be generated from some spreadsheet. Might make sense to use Starlight for the beginning
