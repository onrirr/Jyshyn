# Jyshyn - Open source interactive language learning

Jyshyn, <kbd> /jɯʃɯn/</kbd> or <kbd>yışın</kbd> is a platform created to bring endangered or less attention receiving languages to global audiences in an open source and collaborative format with a Duolingo-like gamified approach.

## Why?

Some languages are widely spoken with little to no resources and some are not spoken well whatsoever. We bring languages to global audiences in order to better promote the cultural diversity of the world.
